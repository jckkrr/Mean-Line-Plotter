A Python script that converts a DataFrame into an interactive Plotly chart mapping the available data and then overlays these with a line showing the rolling mean of all data points. Allows for formatting alterations. In the example below, three years of flight traffic data from aiports across remote Western Australia are plotted, in order to show the trend of increasing air traffic in the state.
